# Training_cpp
Random Project for training use cpp

Project 1 creat a mini game terminal in cpp.

need to use :
- class abstratc , interface, heritage, exeption for error, file log for msg error, inventary, objects (trophy, potion, ...)

Bonus to add : ci/cd is recommended (personal).

What my programe need to do :
- show a message in the strat of the game and ask to creat a playeur.
- start a game chose the dificulty 1-2-3.
- create lots for reward (the lot need be diffferente according to your scores).
- if you do less to 5 good answer -1 hp, less to 8 get potion hp (can be use by the playeur), more than 8 get a trophy (can be use by the playeur).
- afther all round back to the main menu need to show : play, inventory, change difficulty, scores,exit (need have 0 leaks).
- play : start game.
- inventory show inventory item in the forma | nb slot| name item| quantity
- change diffivulty : show actual difficulty and ask the level you want to change.
- save the scores in a files.
- exit : exit proprely the program.

Rules:
- In complilation all .o need to go to a Folder Obj.
- Any function implemented in a header (except in the case of templates), and anyunprotected header means 0 to the exercise.
- you will use and learn C++98 only. The goal is for you to learn the basic of an object oriented programming language.
- The imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names, and method names.
- The following functions are FORBIDDEN, and their use will be punished by a 0, no questions asked: *alloc, *printf and free.
- Also note that unless otherwise stated, the C++ keywords "using namespace" and "friend" are forbidden. Their use will be punished by a -42, no questions asked.
- Since you are allowed to use the C++ tools you learned about since the beginning, you are not allowed to use any external library. And before you ask, that also means no C++11 and derivatives, nor Boost or anything else.
- Your code has to be compiled with the following flags : -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
- By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

In Bonus :

- ask if you want add other playeur and switch them (but they need to conserve they inventory intact)
- the scores file need be always tidy from top to the last
- id you have idea too add show us ;).

Now go work ;).
